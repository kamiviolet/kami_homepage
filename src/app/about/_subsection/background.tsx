          The internet should have been much better than in the past, with more
          stable connection, reliable security, faster speed, and mainly
          everything affordable for everyone, but somehow I feel something
          precious is missing when it was here in the past, when everyone was
          amateur but passionate, creating homepage in the web to share their
          interests, and put a piece of themselves into it, not for job
          opportunities, or business.

        Being one of the nerds at school, I was always grateful for the
        existence of computer and the internet, that I could access to
        information. I liked to explore materials to learn various softwares
        without waiting for my computer teacher to introduce to us. In early
        2000s, I hosted my first homepage in Geocities JP. It was fun to play
        with various themes and designs for my homepage.

      <p>That was old story though.</p>

        Despite my passion about science, I am also fascinated by history and
        ended up in humanities. I studied Religious studies and Philosophy for
        my first degree and then pursued Japanese Studies for my postgraduate. I
        learnt to skim tons of information and make analysis out of it. I became
        good at it and mainly, enjoyed it a lot.

        Theory cannot be totally extracted from practice. I resigned my job and
        then travelled from Hong Kong through Siberia to the UK by land in 2015
        summer. I wished to experience different culture and understand people
        more. I made connection with various encounters, working as waitress at
        busy restaurant, babysitter, carer, sale assistant at supermarket and
        machine operator in manufacturing sector.

        In 2021 summer, thanks to a friend, I hesitantly decided to resume my
        exploration to technology through freeCodeCamp. Deeper I digged into it,
        more amazed by the drastic changes over these years. After almost a year
        of self taught journey, here I am, I joined my coding bootcamp offered
        by Northcoders to learn with other peers and mentors.

      <h2>Vision</h2>
      <p>
        Humanity can get this far because we learnt from experience and pass our
        knowledge around and to next generation. Despite my long pause in
        technology, I gained various experience in my life and I believe I could
        apply mine into programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        The internet has been improved over these years in many aspects and
        that&apos;s all thanks to our constant search for betterness. I aspire
        to instill the insight gained from my study in humanities and my
        experience with people into any projects I work for, to add more colours
        into this vast boundaryless community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, I wish to encourage everyone to join with me, to embrace the
        internet which should belong to everyone, to express themselves and
        creativity.
